# World Population SQL Practise II

In this project, you’ll answer questions using a database of world population by country.

There are two tables:

countries (incl.
  - id
  - name
  - continent
 )
 
 population_years (incl.
  - id
  - population
  - year
  - country_id
 )
 
 My gist is here: https://gist.github.com/dbf37d55b63cb5f5a3faac59d3746b7f

### VERSION 1

--- How many entries in the countries table are from Africa?
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM countries
WHERE continent = 'Africa';

--- What was the total population of the continent of Oceania in 2005?
WITH new_joint AS (
  SELECT *
  FROM population_years
  LEFT JOIN countries
    ON population_years.country_id = countries.id
)
SELECT SUM(population)
FROM new_joint
WHERE continent = 'Oceania' AND year = 2005;

--- What is the average population of countries in South America in 2003?
WITH population_years_countries AS (
  SELECT *
  FROM population_years
  LEFT JOIN countries
    ON population_years.country_id = countries.id
)
SELECT AVG(population)
FROM population_years_countries
WHERE continent = 'South America' AND year = 2003;

--- What country had the smallest population in 2007?
WITH population_years_countries AS (
  SELECT *
  FROM population_years
  LEFT JOIN countries
    ON population_years.country_id = countries.id
)
SELECT name, continent, MIN(population)
FROM population_years_countries
WHERE year = 2007;

--- What is the average population of Poland during the time period covered by this dataset?
WITH population_years_countries AS (
  SELECT *
  FROM population_years
  LEFT JOIN countries
    ON population_years.country_id = countries.id
)
SELECT name, ROUND(AVG(population), 2) AS avg_poplulation
FROM population_years_countries
WHERE name = 'Poland';

--- How many countries have the word “The” in their name?
SELECT *
FROM countries
WHERE name LIKE '%The%';

--- What was the total population of each continent in 2010?
WITH population_years_countries AS (
  SELECT *
  FROM population_years
  LEFT JOIN countries
    ON population_years.country_id = countries.id
)
SELECT continent, SUM(population)
FROM population_years_countries
WHERE year = 2010
GROUP BY continent;

--- How many countries have the word “The” in their name?
SELECT *
FROM countries
