### Trends in Startups

--- Getting started, take a look at the startups table:
SELECT *
FROM startups;

--- Calculate the total number of companies in the table.
SELECT COUNT(name)
FROM startups;

--- What's the total value of all companies in this table?
SELECT SUM(valuation)
FROM startups;

--- What is the highest amount raised by a startup?
SELECT MAX(raised), name
FROM startups;

--- Edit the query so that it returns the maximum amount of money raised, during ‘Seed’ stage.
SELECT MAX(raised), name
FROM startups
WHERE stage = 'Seed';

--- In what year was the oldest company on the list founded?
SELECT MIN(founded), name
FROM startups;

--- Find out the valuations among different sectors:
SELECT category, AVG(valuation)
FROM startups
GROUP BY category;

--- Round the averages to two decimal places.
SELECT category, ROUND(AVG(valuation), 2) AS 'avg_valuation'
FROM startups
GROUP BY category;

--- Lastly, order the list from highest averages to lowest.
SELECT category, ROUND(AVG(valuation), 2) AS 'avg_valuation'
FROM startups
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

--- What are the most competitive markets?
SELECT category, COUNT(*)
FROM startups
GROUP BY category
HAVING COUNT(*) > 3
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

--- Let's see if there's a difference in startups sizes among different locations:
SELECT location, AVG(employees)
FROM startups
GROUP BY location
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

--- What is the average size of a startup in each location, with average sizes above 500?
SELECT location, AVG(employees)
FROM startups
GROUP BY location
HAVING AVG(employees) > 500
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
