# first-steps
My first ever project.

Hi there!

Judith here, I have been wanting to learn programming for a while and now that I'm in isolation due to #covid-19 pandemic/crisis I thought it would be a good time to get to it. Jokes on me, I just quit my FT job and was supposed to be travelling aroud the SE Asia but instead here I am. 

I'm interested in becoming a data scientist and this should be fun!


Peace,J
